                    <h2>About Web Development</h2>
                    <p>Web development, also known as website development, refers to the tasks 
                        associated with creating, building, and maintaining websites and web applications 
                        that run online on a browser. It may, however, also include web design, web programming, 
                        and database management.<br><br>
                        Web development is closely related to the job of designing the features and functionality 
                        of apps (web design). The term development is usually reserved for the actual construction of 
                        these things (that is to say, the programming of sites).<br><br>
                        The basic tools involved in web development are programming languages called HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), 
                        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript. There are, however, a number of other programs used to “manage” or 
                        facilitate the construction of sites that would otherwise have to be done “from scratch” by writing code. 
                        A number of content management systems (CMS) fall into this category, including WordPress, Joomla!, Drupal, 
                        TYPO3, and Adobe Experience Manager, among others.</p>

                    <h2>About CSS Layout</h2>
                    <p>Introduction to CSS layout<br>This article will recap some of the CSS layout features we've already touched upon 
                        in previous modules — such as different display values — and introduce some of the concepts we'll be covering 
                        throughout this module.<br><br>
                        Normal flow<br>Elements on webpages lay themselves out according to normal flow - until we do something to change 
                        that. This article explains the basics of normal flow as a grounding for learning how to change it.<br><br>
                        
                        Flexbox<br>Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method for laying out items in rows or columns. Items flex to fill 
                        additional space and shrink to fit into smaller spaces. This article explains all the fundamentals. After studying 
                        this guide you can test your flexbox skills to check your understanding before moving on.<br><br>
                        
                        Grids<br>CSS grid layout is a two-dimensional layout system for the web. It lets you lay content out in rows and columns,
                        and has many features that make building complex layouts straightforward. This article will give you all you need to know 
                        to get started with page layout, then test your grid skills before moving on.<br><br>
                        
                        Floats<br>Originally for floating images inside blocks of text, the float property became one of the most commonly used tools
                        for creating multiple column layouts on webpages. With the advent of flexbox and grid it has now returned to its original 
                        purpose, as this article explains.<br><br>
                        
                        Positioning<br>Positioning allows you to take elements out of the normal document layout flow and make them behave differently, 
                        for example, by sitting on top of one another, or by always remaining in the same place inside the browser viewport. This article 
                        explains the different position values and how to use them.<br><br>
                        
                        Multiple-column layout<br>The multiple-column layout specification gives you a method of laying content out in columns, as you might 
                        see in a newspaper. This article explains how to use this feature.<br><br>
                        
                        Responsive design<br>As more diverse screen sizes have appeared on web-enabled devices, the concept of responsive web design (RWD) has 
                        appeared: a set of practices that allows web pages to alter their layout and appearance to suit different screen widths, resolutions, 
                        etc. It is an idea that changed the way we design for a multi-device web, and in this article we'll help you understand the main techniques 
                        you need to know to master it.</p>
